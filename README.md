## Protocol roadmap
- **v1** – baseline intent detection with scripted tests and stable EDN output.
- **v2** – POS tagging plus parse-aware memory summaries (still deterministic).
- **v3a** – classical (no LLM) NER + entity-relation graph + suggestion hooks.

Each protocol is selectable via `--protocol basic-chat/vN` in `apps/basic-chat-demo`.
